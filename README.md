# wolfgang_constant_voltage
Constant Voltage regulator for the Wolfgang OP Robot

## Description
The Dynamixel motors used in the Wolfgang OP act differently depending on the supplied voltage.

Therefore we decided to fix the voltage by using a DC/DC converter. It steps down the voltage from a 6 cell LiPo battery to a selectable voltage. We use 15.4 V as the output voltage.
